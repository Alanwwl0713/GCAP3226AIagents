Working on Team 4's municipal solid waste charging project for GCAP3226 has transformed my understanding of data-driven environmental policy in Hong Kong. Through drafting our enquiry to the Environmental Protection Department, I learned the importance of precision in government communication. Our focus on the Food Waste Recycling Scheme's core service targets and PRH estate participation rates demonstrated that specific, well-defined requests are crucial for obtaining meaningful data.

Throughout this process, I discovered the unique synergy between AI tools and human expertise in policy research. The AI system helped me streamline our enquiry by suggesting the removal of international comparisons that could complicate our request. What impressed me most was how the AI complemented my own policy insights - while it helped refine the technical aspects of our questions, my understanding of Hong Kong's waste management context guided us to focus specifically on operational efficiency metrics and participation rate methodologies that would be most relevant for local implementation.

This experience revealed that effective data access requires both technical precision and strategic thinking. By streamlining our enquiry to focus on core operational metrics rather than broad comparisons, we increased our chances of receiving useful data. I now understand that successful policy analysis depends not just on what data you request, but how you structure your enquiry to align with government data management practices.

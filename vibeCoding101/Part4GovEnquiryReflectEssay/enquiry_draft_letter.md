1.⁠ ⁠Clarify the Food Waste Recycling Scheme’s core service targets (commercial/industrial/households) + basis; confirm "PRH estate participation rate" calculation methodology and FWSRBs’ operational efficiency data.

2.⁠ ⁠Retain the inquiry about the Smart Food Waste Recycling Programme (PRH)’s recycling rate.

3.⁠ ⁠Temporarily remove Hong Kong’s food waste recycling comparison with Singapore, South Korea, Taipei (vague scope, inconsistent cross-region data standards; local data prioritized for timely response).

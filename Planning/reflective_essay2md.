Working on Team 4’s municipal solid waste charging project for GCAP3226 has deepened my understanding of how data-driven approaches shape environmental policy in Hong Kong. Drafting our enquiry to the Environmental Protection Department under the Code on Access to Information was a pivotal experience. I learned that effective government communication requires precise, well-justified requests—vague questions rarely yield useful data. Our team’s focus on waste generation patterns and compliance rates made it essential to identify exactly which quantitative metrics and policy documents to request.

AI assistance played a valuable role in structuring our enquiry and refining the language for professionalism. The agent helped clarify our objectives and suggested ways to frame our questions, but I found that selecting relevant data sources and interpreting policy context still required human judgment. The process highlighted the importance of critical thinking when collaborating with AI, especially since automated suggestions can miss subtle policy nuances.

This experience has shown me that access to government data is not automatic; it demands strategic communication and persistence. By combining AI tools with our own analysis, we are better equipped to evaluate policy effectiveness and recommend improvements. I now appreciate how data access and professional enquiry skills are essential for evidence-based policy advocacy and real-world impact.
